# Task15
## Capstone Project II
This project was created so that I could apply the HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages that I've learnt in my bootcamp with HyperionDev.
This is an online clothing store that allows users to add items to their cart and see their total due. It also includes different payment methods for users to choose from.
This website includes a lookbook of all the clothing items for the user to look at, an About Us page, Home page, a Shopping Cart and a Catalogue page as well as individual pages
for each clothing item.
