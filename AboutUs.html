            <p class="aboutusp"><b>Essentials</b> is a company with a straight-forward vision: to create a high-end
                streetwear clothing
                line. Essentials was funded and founded, by founder, <b>Jerry Lorenzo</b><span>(right).</span> As a
                company, we aim
                to provide two main things: comfortability and a clean, modern aesthetic to the modern streetwear scene
                and culture.
                <br>
                <br>

                Jerry Lorenzo has recently entered a groundbreaking long-term partnership with <a

                “This is a role that is unprecedented in its very nature and nuanced attribution
                that it defies all titles and traditional definitions. This is a fearless move
                where shared vision and conviction are at the heart of the accretion of two brands
                shaping sports and culture, with the purpose to truly multiply our nuanced strengths
                to revolutionize the performance basketball industry forever.” says Jerry Lorenzo of ESSENTIALS/Fear of
                God.
                “adidas and
                <a href="https://fearofgod.com/pages/seventh-collection">Fear of God</a>
                share the same dream for the future of basketball, on and beyond the court,
                and we look forward to changing the face of the industry through a new model that will unfold before
                us in the coming years.”
